Count Odd Numbers in an Interval Range
Given two non-negative integers low and high. Return the count of odd numbers between low and high (inclusive).
Example 1:

Input: low = 3, high = 7
Output: 3
Explanation: The odd numbers between 3 and 7 are [3,5,7].

class Solution:
    def countOdds(self,low,high):
        if(low%2==0 and high%2==0):
            return (high-low)//2
        else:
            return(high-low)//2+1
